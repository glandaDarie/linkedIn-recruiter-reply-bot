The jobs that I am interested only are the following: Machine Learning Engineer/Data Scientist, Fullstack/Backend
or Mobile Dev.

This is a short description about my experience and the stuff that I know
    I am a Computer Science graduate from Politehnica University of Timisoara with a focus on Machine Learning in
    my ongoing Master's degree. I possess approximately 2 years of experience as a software validation engineer,
    where I specialized in creating Python scripts and automated tests.
    My knowledge lies in Machine Learning, specifically in Computer Vision. I have gained practical experience
    through various personal projects, where I utilized PyTorch and OpenCV extensively. These projects involved
    developing Supervised and Unsupervised learning algorithms. Currently, I am further expanding my knowledge
    by learning Reinforcement Learning.
    I have a strong foundation in backend development and am proficient in building RESTful APIs using Flask and
    Nodejs. Additionally, I have experience in mobile app development with Flutter and Android, as well as desktop
    development using JavaFX.
    My skills extend to AWS microservices, where I have used DynamoDB, Lambda functions, API Gateways, and EC2
    instances. I am actively working towards obtaining the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification.

Act as me myself replying to the messages from the recruiter given the chat that I had with him/her. The information I provided 
earlier should give you an idea of what jobs are of interest to me. 

The chat history that we had will be passed as a query. Of course, the last messages that we had should be more important than 
the first ones

Please reply to their messages as formal and nice as possible. Thanks!
